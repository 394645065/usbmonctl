usbmonctl - USB HID Monitor Control Utility

Useful when cloning machines including CMOS settings - to preserve service
tags (which would be cloned too otherwise).

Requirements:
-------------
Linux, GCC, Make

Compilation:
------------
$ make

Installation:
-------------
# make install

This installs usbmonctl to /usr/bin and 95-usbmonctl-monitor.rules to
/etc/udev/rules.d.
The udev rule is needed to allow non-root users to control a monitor. It sets
group "video" on all hiddev* devices that are USB HID monitors.

Usage:

Tested and working monitors:

Samsung SyncMaster 757DFX (0x0419:0x8002)
